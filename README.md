In this Challenge I aim to successfully modify ecommerce database from a REST client through the back end.
To run,
you would need a .env file with the following contents under the main root:
DB_NAME='ecommerce_db'
DB_USER='YOUR_USERNAME'
DB_PASSWORD='YOUR_PASSWORD'

run "npm i" to install requirements
load "schema.sql" with mysql by "SOURCE schema.sql"
run "npm run seed" to initialize data.
run "node server" to start the server.
port will be "localhost:3001"
